## Setting up your computing environment
Scikit-learn provides an easy to use streamlined API that provides efficient versions of a large number of common algorithms and makes it easy to train models.   

The goal of this talk is to create machine learning models using scikit-learn. 
Before you can do machine learning, you need to be able to program with python. For the purposes of this workshop, we're offering 2 recommended methods of setting up your computing environment.

    <td>Anaconda</td>
    <td>It comes with a collection of many open sources packages (NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, and pandas to name a few)</td>
    <td>Easier to work with larger datasets than a free version of colab.</br> Easier to save your work and load data than Colab.</td>
    <td>Usually more effort to get running than Colab. Helps to have some knowledge of command line (Windows) or terminal (Mac). Harder to share and collaborate than Colab. Installation varies depending on your operating system (Windows, Mac) and a variety of other factors.</td>
    <td>Free though there is a paid version of it at <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/signup">$9.99 per month</a></td>

    <td>Google Colaboratory</td>
    <td>Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python interactively in your browser. </td>
    <td>You don't have to install anything locally on your computer. It comes with a collection of many open source packages (NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, and pandas to name a few). Provides browser-baed Jupyter Notebooks which allows for easy sharing and collaboration. Store notebooks on Google Drive. Free access to GPUs</td>
    <td>Google owns Colab. While it has always been free, it could in the future not be.  If it isn't in future, it is easy to switch to other tools. You need a google account to use. Data loading can more difficult than if you installed python on your computer. Only 1 GB or so of RAM is available</td>
    <td>Free though there is a paid version of it at <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/signup">$9.99 per month</a></td>
